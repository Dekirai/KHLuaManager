# Kingdom Hearts LUA Manager
 A program to easily (de-)activate LUA Scripts in realtime.

## Requirements

 - [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-offline-installer)
 - It uses .NET Framework 4.8 because .NET 5 currently is really buggy on my machine and makes it impossible to work with it.
 
## How to use the program

1. Download the latest version from Releases: [Click here](https://github.com/Dekirai/KHLuaManager/releases)
2. Put the .exe anywhere
3. Run it
4. The program will generate some folders in Documents > Kingdom Hearts 1.5+2.5 ReMIX if they don't exist
5. Place your scripts in the desired folders
6. Press the 'Reload scripts' button to show available scripts
7. Everything else should be self-explanatory
